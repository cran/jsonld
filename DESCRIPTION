Description: JSON-LD <https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/> is a light-weight syntax for 
    expressing linked data. It is primarily intended for web-based programming
    environments, interoperable web services and for storing linked data in 
    JSON-based databases. This package provides bindings to the JavaScript 
    library for converting, expanding and compacting JSON-LD documents.
